**How to submit?**

You may use Issues and Pull Requests, Issues recommended. Please paste the markdown file contents and make sure you include the head items. You can check in the _posts folder to see what it should look like. I will be closing PRs that change any aspect of the website that's not the post you're editing.

The post must be tech related. There's not really a criteria. This is really it. Make sure to add the Category, Date & Time, Author, Tags, all of that.
