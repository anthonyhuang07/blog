            <div class="content"><br>
                <p>This is the first post of the page. I actually have some things to say too! <br><br>
                    Yesterday night was literally hell. It was like 26 degrees outside (felt like 30) and I couldn't
                    sleep. (I had my window open, we didn't have AC on because I think the vents weren't cleaned)
                    Luckily, the weather report said it was going to rain for 40 minutes, and I was so relieved. So I
                    waited, and it was time. Guess what? IT DIDN'T EVEN RAIN. I ended up with 6 hours of sleep which is
                    a new low this year.<br><br>
                    Anyways, I went to school, we had an annoying geography test that I definitely failed on, and we
                    started the movies unit in French.<br><br>
                    Break passed, played Geometry Dash, nothing special, and as I'm writing this in Math class, I wanted
                    to get an image from my Saved Images folder. Guess what? NOTHING. LITERALLY NOTHING. EVERYTHING WAS
                    GONE! There wasn't anything in my Recycle Bin either. I'm pretty sure my drive suffered data loss
                    after I installed Linux. RIP<br><br>
                    I didn't really have any important images there, but they were super awesome and cool, and cool
                    looking timelines in Premiere, 1st in Kahoot, donations, all that stuff. But it was all gone, and I
                    am sad.<br><br>
                    However, the good news is that our math test got pushed to Wednesday, and that's fun. Yay??<br><br>
                    Just got my Unit 3 math test back, and I got 100, 86, 86 and 52 (ðŸ’€) However it wasn't that bad, its
                    overall 81 and my math overall OVERALL mark went from 85 to 86! GGs!!!!<br><br>
                    I am also proud to say that I got collapsibles working on here! This page has been finally uploaded
                    to GitHub Pages.<br><br>
                    Anyways, that's it for today, goodbye! (I'm writing this the next day because i forgor)

                <p>Hey guys, I don't think this day is going to be interesting but I have something I want to
                    show.<br><br>
                    Before that, I started the day biking to school with sore legs, and I arrived a bit late, but it was
                    fine. <br><br>
                    Right now in Geography class, I just finished writing my Wikia article for this fictional universe
                    called the G9DS. It has a big lore surrounding it, about the Grade 9 Discord Server, and I suggest
                    you read up on the articles, but you should definitely check <a
                        href="https://nengipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anthony_Huang">my article</a> first.<br><br>
                    I wasn't expecting anything funny to happen today, but right after we left geo, my friend and some
                    other people were walking in the hallways heading to our next classes, and our geo teacher passed
                    by. My friend loudly said "AU REVOIR MADAME!" literally leaning outwards and yelling, and guess
                    what? She looked at him dead in the eye soulless, ignoring him, saying nothing, and walking past
                    him. IT WAS SO FUNNY LMFAO<br><br>
                    I also died at 93% on Nantendo during break, GG<br><br>
                    Other than that, I started decorating my Geometry Dash level, and I spent 4 hours only decorating
                    about 5%.<br><br>
                    That's all from me for today. GOODBYE!

                <p>GOOD MORNIng GOOd evENING everyone I have lots of news that I didn't bother writing yesterday!
                    <br><br>
                    Small stuff: I submitted my geography project, did my math test, and got 12% on Acu (an Extreme
                    Demon!)<br><br>
                    Now the highlight of yesterday: My phone broke. Not what you expect, so I'm just going to rant about
                    this more and tell you a bit of my history with iPhones.<br><br>
                    I have had bad luck with iPhones ever since I got my 2nd iPhone, the iPhone 6, in 2018. Before that,
                    I owned an iPhone 4, which was my grandpa's, and let me say, old iPhones are actually goated. That
                    iPhone 4 had an average of 5 hours battery, and could still run most apps on iOS 7!<br><br>
                    It was getting old though, so my grandma gave me her old phone, the iPhone 6. That was the worst
                    phone I ever owned. Ever since I got it, it had this screen issue, where the entire touchscreen was
                    unresponsive sometimes, and the only way to fix it is to turn off and on again (not like entirely
                    reboot, just go to the lock screen and back home) it was very annoying. Another issue was the
                    battery. It only lasted like 1-2 hours, and it would often restart because it could reach the
                    necessary peak power. This means that the battery was EXTREMELY used, and it was in really bad
                    condition.<br><br>
                    Anyways, being me, my anger couldn't handle it, and I broke the screen. While I continued using it
                    for a while, I eventually switched to my mom's Galaxy S4 Mini for a while. Now the S4 Mini is a
                    goated phone.<br><br>
                    Now if you're wondering "Why can't he just switch to android?!!?!?" well.... my About Me partially
                    explains it, but also, I have an Apple Watch, AirPods Pro, and soon a MacBook, and I pay for
                    iCloud+, so I really can't leave anymore. If I had the chance, I definitely would.<br><br>
                    I don't want to flood this section, so I just gonna briefly explain how I broke my next iPhones.
                    <br><br>
                    iPhone 7 (1) - My mom's, it worked perfectly fine, I even got a dBrand decal for it, but one day I
                    decided to repair an iPhone for the first time, by replacing its degraded battery. What I didn't
                    know at the time, was that iPhones had waterproof seals, and if you open them, they break. I didn't
                    know I had to buy one. So yeah, water damage.<br><br>
                    iPhone 7 (2) - from Amazon Renewed - worked perfectly fine, until the known No Service issue on
                    iPhone 7s occured. Luckily, I got a refund for this one.<br><br>
                    iPhone 8 - from Amazon Renewed - worked perfectly fine, some cosmetic damage, but other than that,
                    the phone is great! One day however, I was taking a slowmotion video of underwater footage, and
                    WATER DAMAGE. Now I wondered "How did this even break??? It has a waterproof seal, right?" I never
                    opened it, so it shouldn't be broken! Well guess what, after the screen got absolutely destroyed by
                    the water, I opened it up. IT WAS SO EASY TO OPEN UP. Now when you open an iPhone with a waterproof
                    seal, it's super hard to open, because it acts like some type of glue. The iPhone 8 opened up so
                    easily, and I think it's because the Amazon Renewed employees didn't bother putting in a waterproof
                    seal. There were so many other missing parts too! I made a full video on my experience with Amazon
                    Renewed, or at least a video portraying the average Amazon Renewed worker. Watch it <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t32xYZPREKc">here.</a> I did not get a refund for this as
                    it was 6 months out of refund range, so that's $200 down the drain.<br><br>
                    Ever since then, I've never bought Amazon Renewed ever again. I didn't have a phone for around 4
                    months, and didn't buy one because I was very poor. I had to use my iPad as a "Phone" throughout
                    that time.<br><br>
                    That brings us to today. My iPhone XS. This one cost $390, off eBay, because I was done with Amazon.
                    This was the best phone I've owned since the iPhone 4, and the only problem was that it restarted
                    randomly, but that was like once a month, and other than that, the phone was in perfect cosmetic
                    condition.<br><br>
                    (My friend Liam wanted to be mentioned, so here you go)<br><br>
                    So recently, I've been dropping my phone a lot. Yesterday, I dropped my phone on very soft concrete,
                    so I thought it was fine. I went home, and at night, it came in contact with water, and the camera
                    got blurry. I got worried and wondered if my phone was actually open, but no. The camera cover split
                    open. Then out of nowhere, it started boot looping. Now I decided to try this method for the first
                    time - putting my phone in rice. Now this morning, it works fine, and I even washed and gorilla
                    glued the camera cover back on. I can tell the quality is slightly degraded, but it's still useable
                    and good quality.<br><br>
                    So that's the rant. I won't be switching to Android any time soon, despite me really wanting to.

            <div class="content"><br>
                <p>good afternoon guys, small news - my iphone camera can't focus close range and long range, and I'm
                    planning to get it repaired. I got 43% on future funk, got the dual part down.<br><br>
                    Today's quote of the day is: OH MY GOD!!! *hyperventilates in disbelief* OH MY GOD
                    YEEEEEEEEEESSSSS!!! YES! YES! YES! YES! *sobbing* Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my
                    god, oh my, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god i did it! Oh my god, oh my god, oh
                    my god! *intense sobbing* Oh my god, oh my god, i did it! Oh my god, oh my god! *even more intense
                    sobbing*<br><br>
                    most people today are at a field trip in Justin Bieber's hometown to watch a play called Chicago, so
                    classes are mostly empty today.<br><br>
                    Here's the highlight of the day - so today is international ramen day or something, and the school
                    was selling bowl noodles. I got one, but THEY DIDN'T HAVE HOT WATER. The only water I had was cold,
                    so I just dealt with it, until my friend suggested an idea.<br><br>
                    So my other friend wanted me to bring my screwdriver set to school because he wanted to open his
                    MacBook, so having my set, I opened my own computer, and you know what I did? i put the bowl on the
                    huge piece of copper sheet, I think it's responsible for keeping the heat, and then the fan
                    disperses it. I put it on there, opened HOW on Geometry Dash (one of the highest object levels in
                    geometry dash), all my adobe programs, vscode, basically every program that uses a lot of system
                    components. The PC got extremely hot, and it was funny to see if the noodles would heat up.<br><br>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CFPcHha.jpg" alt="bowl noodles on heatsink" width="400px" /><br>
                    The end result: still pretty cold, but it dispersed enough that I could eat it. It was actually
                    pretty good, despite it being cold. 7.175/10.<br><br>
                    Quote of the hour: But you didn't have to cut me off, Make out like it never happened and that we
                    were nothing. And I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so
                    rough. You didn't have to stoop so low, have your friends collect your records and then change your
                    number. I guess that I don't need that though, now you're just somebody that I used to know, now
                    you're just somebody that I used to know<br><br>
                    Also, since there's a field trip today, and it's on a play, most drama students are gone. By most,
                    only 5 people showed up today in drama class. There were other people in the hallways that didn't
                    come to class, so we just spent most of the class time having a conversation with the teacher as a
                    group.<br><br>
                    Nothing else interesting. Goodbye!

                <p>gonna just do a quick issue, today was nothing interesting, but we had a huge thunderstorm that
                    lasted like half an hour, and apparently 2 people died. It was really bad. The rest of the day was
                    just me trying to do 54-100 on Future Funk, but I got 54-99 :/ Goodbye!

                <p>Hey y'all! (scott here) sorry i havent posted in a while, i was never motivated to post until a few
                    days ago, but nothing interesting happened until today.<br><br>
                    It started in drama class, we were doing an equity forum. Basically something the school does to
                    "support" students mental health and all that, talking about how to deal with harmful language or
                    whatever. (It isn't really that helpful)<br><br>
                    So they were talking about how we could make the school a safer place and whatnot, and class was
                    ending. So we decided to all get up and head over to the room where all our stuff is to pack up and
                    get home, until the PA SYSTEM JUST SAID "A LOCKDOWN HAS BEEN ISSUED THIS IS NOT A DRILL" we went
                    into full panic mode, and that's when the story began.<br><br>
                    ~2:30 - we get into the room and everyone stays, doors are locked, lights are out. Everyone is
                    worried, finding new information.<br><br>
                    2:42 - <a href="https://twitter.com/HRPSOak/status/1531707630841896962?cxt=HHwWhICxwbL-28EqAAAA">New
                        information:</a> place is under investigation, everyone is still worried, not much information
                    we have<br><br>
                    ~2:55 - SWAT/Police with flashlight Assault Rifles came into the room, asked for a [REDACTED] (we
                    later find out that's the suspect's name) He is a grade 11 perm boy, we thought he was grade 12. It
                    is surprising to see an 05 as the suspect.<br><br>
                    ~3:19 - Suspect in custody, he had a replica handgun, and it was for drama class ðŸ’€ then someone
                    called the police because they thought it was real. GG!<br><br>
                    The entire process was nerve wracking, and it was my first serious school emergency. I have more
                    proofs I want to put here for future usage:<br>

                <p>In the end, it was a "cool" experience and I finally got to experience a real emergency. Was it real
                    though? In the end, it was a big misunderstanding, and the guy's reputation is now ruined. It's also
                    ironic how that just a few minutes before the lockdown, we were talking about how we would make our
                    school a safer place. Guess what happened next...<br><br>
                    Then I biked home in 32 degree weather and died. The end!</p>
