                <p>Hello guys, happy late Canada Day! This happened yesterday, but it was late and didn't have time to blog this.<br><br>
                    I beat the Ender Dragon! This is my first time beating it, but it wasn't solo, it was with friends. Here's the whole story. <br><br>
                    It started with the Li Institution gang wanting to speedrun Minecraft, and so we did. Hello56721 dropped out soon because of his parents, so it was just me and carpetmaker. We did lots of stuff, mining, etc. Got to the portal, then we spent the rest of the days bartering piglins for ender pearls. Eventually we got to the stronghold, and that's when newcomer to the Li Institution 2ndDeity joined, and we did our stuff. We got the portal, and we went in.<br><br>
                    It was crazy at first. We all died because we weren't coordinated, carpetmaker dropped out because it was late for him, so it was just me and 2ndDeity. We fought, but we realised a few minutes in that the AI of the Ender Dragon broke. It kept going the same pattern and we just kept shooting it and got it down to less than half health. <br><br>
                    We restarted the server and surely, the ender dragon went back to normal. You can watch the rest that happened below.<br><br>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXf29HY28D0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
                    (P.S. The hitboxes aren't hacks, they're built into Minecraft. Just press F3+B. Also, I'm the guy with the low quality mic, in case you haven't noticed.)<br><br>
                    So yeah, we beat the ender dragon, but there's one thing - we actually kinda cheated. You see whenever we died and lost our beds, we would ask the server owner (Hello56721) to teleport us back. It was kinda scuffed too, with him messing around with commands, so we've decided to redo it.<br><br>
                    That's it though, so bye bozos (and i also destroyed the server lmfao)

                <p>Hey guys, starting today, I will be updating daily until Wednesday (i will try to) because I started a Linux challenge on Wednesday. A few days ago, I decided to switch from elementaryOS to Kubuntu, and finally try out KDE. And the results? Kubuntu is my new favorite desktop environment. Every other DE i've used has always ended up with me feeling like I'm using an alien OS. Not anymore though, with Kubuntu, problems are minimal, and the experience feels like home.<Br><Br>
                    So I started customizing, I tried making it look like macOS, but after using latte dock, I decided not to. Then I tried a Windows 11 style- that didn't go well either. So I just said screw it, I'm making my own thing. I chose a One Dark-styled theme (the theme I use for VSCode) and the result is now this:<br><br>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OVvQAik.png" width="850px"/><br><br>
                    I think it looks fine now. Some problems I ran into along the way was the KDE store not working from the settings tab, to quickly install themes and such. But I just installed them from the website as files, so it's fine.<br><br>
                    Later on, I got my games working. First was Minecraft, with all the mods, resource packs, and Fabric, all working. Then Geometry Dash, which was the first time I got MegaHack working on Linux. Minecraft actually plays really smoothly (since it's natively supported) but with Geometry Dash supported only with Proton, sometimes I experience slowdowns and lag. Kinda annoying but it's playable. The FPS counter is actually higher than on Windows!<br><Br>
                    After all this happened, I finally decided to start the Linux Challenge. So we start with Day 1 now.<br><br>
                    <h2>Day 1</h2><br><br>
                    <p>
                    I played around with the KDE system sounds, and despite them being from 2008, they still sound extremely modern and as good as any other operating system sounds I've heard.<br><br>
                    One issue I later came across was the keyboard. On a Windows keyboard, the Function (FN) keys do something completely different, so I had to switch to Apple Keyboard mode, remap some keys, and swap the alt and meta (Windows/Command) key.<br><br>
                    Then I had Python classes (easy) and installed Zoom. It was UGLY<br><Br>
                    Oh, and some other words that I haven't mentioned: Spectacle (the screenshotting tool) is amazing. It might not be Snipping Tool, but it's way better than every other screenshotting tool i've used on Linux. 9/10. And the wobbly windows effect is cool<br><br>
                    I got VSCode, and thank god for Settings Sync, I didn't have to deal with resetting up VSCode. All my extensions, themes, and settings were here. Nothing new.<br><br>
                    Later, I noticed that my 18GB root partition was almost becoming full, so I had to resize it. Only thing was, most partitions were in use, so I couldnt move/resize much. So after class, I got GParted on my flash drive, resized everything, and now my root partition is 26GB. Also, the GParted desktop environment looked like garbage. (I know it's supposed to be just one program, but still, looks like garbage)<br><br>
                    Then I tried Thunderbird for the first time. It's the same as the GParted live USB. LOOKS LIKE GARBAGE. For me, it's web or nothing for email (unless you're talking the Apple Mail app, that one looks very good and I use it on my iPhone)<br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Day 2</h2><br><br>
                <p>I started the day with getting MegaHack working on Geometry Dash. After multiple attempts, it finally worked. Big good job<bR><br>
                    Then I donated 2 euros to KDE because I really love the DE<br><br>
                    After that, I realised I didn't have a video recording software. On Windows, I would use xbox game bar (because OBS was very slow and recorded at like 5fps [I dont have a good computer]) so my friend recommended Kazam to me. Overall, it's just as good as xbox game bar, but some problems include the performance. On Minecraft, it worked fine, no issues. But on Geometry Dash, it would slow down my game exponentially, and causes massive input delay. The FPS count stays the same for some reason.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Day 3 (Today)</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    Not much really happened today. I did boot up Windows, but not for what you think (I'm not just gonna stop the challenge) I only went on there to save my Geometry Dash save file to the cloud so I can play on Linux (it doesn't autosave)<br><br>
                    Later, I got the audio for Kazam working, and recorded some <a href="https://streamable.com/235oig">Geometry Dash footage</a> (with extreme lag, but it doesn't show on the video)<br><br>
                    Which leads us to now, which I had some problems with Git at first with VSCode, but that has been resolved. And that's it! Stay tuned for tomorrow (Day 4!) oh wait i completely forgot, the challenge lasts for 1 week
                </p>

                <h2>Day 4</h2>
                <p>
                    Only thing that happened today was with recording software. I realised my game runs better with Kazam on 15fps, but that looks really bad. So I finally decided to use OBS again, and I underestimated it. I had always set it to 1080p60, which isn't ideal for my computer. I set it to 480p30 this time, and it works way better than Kazam. I was even able to beat a part of a Geometry Dash level while recording: <br><br>

                    Another thing I want to mention is after the Linux Challenge ends, I'm going to try to migrate all this to a database, and make the blogs more tech-centered. I might still intergrate some parts of what happened in my life, but who knows<br><br>
                    Stay tuned for tomorrow (is anyone even reading this) goodbye
