### What is this post for?

This post was written to help the future IB students (of WOSS specifically) guide their way through the mess of IB. This post will be long, so if you only want the specific information of a topic you are confused about, check out the **Contents** tab on the right side of the page.

If you have a question that the guide does not answer, you can leave a comment below (you need a GitHub account) or you can DM me on Discord at **@fhdhgngn**.

### Who are you?

My name is Anthony Huang, and your fellow Grade 11 classmate (or me) may have shared this guide with you. To preface, I am a Grade 12 student (as of the 2024-2025 school year). I am the Co-President of the WOSS Computer Science Club's Practical Section, and overall in IB, I'm a Level 5 average student.

My courses include HL English (LangLit), HL French, HL Geography, SL Physics, SL Chemistry and SL Math. However, since I was in French Immersion, I got to take a spare or an elective for first year, in which I took Grade 11 Computer Science (ICS3U1, Final 96%). Therefore, one of my SLs are in Grade 12, which I will be doing SL Chemistry in the 2024-2025 school year. If any '08s are reading this, there's a chance I might be in your class!

My first year IB exams have ended, where I took the SL Physics and SL Math exams. I was predicted a 4 and 5 respectively, and got a final score of Level 5 in both courses. For HL French, HL Geography and HL English, I ended the first semesters with a 5, 6, and a 5. (Not IB final)

## Experience

### Semester 1

I want to preface by saying this: ALP is nothing like IB. You may have thought ALP's rigor prepared you for IB, but in reality, ALP is the same as regular Academic except you have to take Grade 11 Functions in Grade 10. If you noticed, most ALP classes had a mix of ALP and Academic students. So being in ALP was not special. Personally, I think being in ALP was a better experience to get you to know your future IB classmates so you can get along together better, as you have known eachother for two years (or more!) before IB.

IB at WOSS generally has an enrollment of less than 200 students per grade. There are a few that drop IB after first year due to it being a bad experience for them, but I would estimate the number of people to do so to be 10-30 people. This is a very niche group of students compared to all the Grade 11s in the school, which amounts to a few hundred people.

Semester 1 starts chill. You get to know the feel of IB and connect with your niche group of peers. The months of September to November feel normal, and there is generally no pressure. The month before Winter Break begins, you begin your [IAs](#internal-assessments-ias), where you will only be expected to finish a proposal.

## Grades

### Conversions

The marks you receive in class from tests or assignments, are in a **raw mark** form. Let's say you got a 20/40 on your IB Physics test. That may sound terrible, because that's a 50% and that is edging failure, right? But 50% is your raw IB mark. The mark that appears on your report card (and the marks you send to university) will be a **converted mark**, which the school converts your IB raw marks to Ontario marks. Raw percentages convert to different Ontario percentages based on the course. In IB Physics, a 50% converts to an 84% (Level 5).

The process of converting raw to converted marks is called **conversions**. Each course has different conversions, and a table of conversions is usually provided by your teacher on their Brightspace. Additionally, I have also made a website that converts these grades for you, so you don't need to find your grade on a complicated table. Check it out here: [ah07.xyz/ibconverter](https://ah07.xyz/ibconverter).

While raw conversions are different across courses, the converted mark level boundaries are the same for every course. The following are the minimum converted percentages per level:
- 0% = Level 1
- 50% = Level 2
- 61% = Level 3
- 72% = Level 4
- 84% = Level 5
- 93% = Level 6
- 97% = Level 7

These percentages are **converted**, not **raw**.

### Reports

Wait, weren't we talking about our grades for SL Math? Why is it showing my midterm grade for just MHF4UA?

Because SL Math is split into MHF4UA and MCV4UA (MHF4UA being first semester), you're technically in an MHF4U (Advanced Functions) class. Therefore, your grade for SL Math (thus far) on your **report card** will be your **converted grade**.

However, when your teacher emails you a mark update, they send the **raw** grade instead.

### Predicted Grades

At the end of an IB course (ex. When you have finished all tests for MHF4UA and MCV4UA) your teacher will calculate your predicted grade for SL Math (also your midterm for MCV4UA)

### Final IB Grade

Your final IB Grade is the points you achieve from all your courses plus the extra Core points (Extended Essay + Theory of Knowledge). 36 points are possible from achieving Level 7s in all 6 of your courses (6 times 7), plus a maximum of 3 core points, making the maximum achievable grade 45 IB Points. 

The total number of points only matters for your diploma achievement and if you're applying to universities using your IB Grade (usually only for international applications, because Canadian universities are better to apply with your Ontario grade).

Your IB grade per subject is distributed differently based on the subject. For example, for SL Math, the exam is worth 80%, specifically 40% per paper (two papers), and the IA (Internal Assessment) is worth 20%. The three parts of your final grade are all out of a mark (ex. Paper 1 and 2 of SL Math are out of 80 marks). The marks are turned into raw percentages and then added up together using their weightings.

**The level boundaries for the exams and the IA are not the same as the IB boundaries!** WOSS makes the level boundaries higher than the IB boundaries so you have a better outcome on the IB exam. To find the weightings and the grade boundaries of each section for your final grade, check this website out: [ibpredict.org](https://ibpredict.org/subjects).

Finally, your final raw percentage is then matched to the level boundary of the subject, and your final points for that subject will be based on the level you got.

## Course Information

### HL English (ENG3UA)

HLE, do not do other class work in this class or else the teacher will beat you. homework homework homework

### HL French (FIF3UB)

easy course, embarrassing i didnt get a 6+ idk i threw so hard

### HL Geography (CGF3MB)

easy class, study literally during the week of a test LOL and play games during class (thats what most people did including me and i got a 6 bc i messed up two tests because i didnt pay attention to what i was supposed to know [skill issue])

### SL Physics (SPH3UB, SPH4UB)

IB SL Physics is one of the hardest IB courses you can take at WOSS (alongside HL Math) and they make it extra hard at WOSS. As the Physics syllabus has changed 

### SL Math (MHF4UA, MCV4UA)

## Internal Assessments (IAs)

### What is an IA?

Your IA is like the course summative - it spans the entirety of the IB course, even if it lasts 2+ semesters, and is always going to be a written report. An IA begins with the proposal - an idea of your topic/experiment and how you're going to write, research and execute it. This proposal must be approved by your teacher in order for you to begin. IAs are different across courses. For example, the sciences (Group 4) are all scientific experiments, so you will be to perform an experiment to collect data and write a report.

### Exceptions - Language Subjects

In language subjects such as English, French and Spanish, you will be doing an IO (Individual Oral) instead of an IA. It is how it sounds, being a 1 on 1 oral evaluation with your teacher. (i didnt take sl french/spanish so idk how it goes, im gonna ask some ppl for their experience so i can write this section lol)

## Exams

### First Semester Exams (OSSD)

First semester exams are your regular Ontario exams, and will follow the same procedure as previous years. Sometimes the teacher will do something different for the exam because there's no use for an actual exam really, such as HL Geography, where you would most likely just do your 3rd option's test instead of a full course exam.

The exam will be weighted among the tests you have done in this semester, as usual, and will be part of your final predicted grade for the IB course, and part of your final mark for the Ontario course.

The only exam that really matters in this period is Math, as it will be weighted the usual 30% of your MHF4U mark. This MHF4U mark is a Grade 12 OSSD grade, so if you're applying to university with your Ontario grades, this might be a grade you'll have to show in your application (especially required for programs like engineering/CS)

## CAS (Creativity, Activity, Service)

### What is CAS?

CAS is the IB equivalent of your OSSD volunteer hours. However, in addition to volunteering, you're also given the option to do creative activities (e.g. Piano lessons, going to a school club, etc.) and physical activities (e.g. Going to the gym, weekly house league soccer, etc.). Respectively, these activities go under the Creativity and Activity sections of CAS. For Service, it could be volunteering or doing anything that benefits a community.
