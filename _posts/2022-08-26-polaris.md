## What is Polaris?

[Polaris](https://gdcolon.com/polaris/) is the brand new Discord XP bot made by YouTuber and Programmer [GD Colon.](https://youtube.com/GDColon) 

It is like your average XP bot, except there's absolutely ZERO paywalls, and is blazingly fast! There's also some very useful features that other XP bots do not have.

It also doesn't use any intents, so it doesn't use up any unnecessary memory, which is part of why it makes the bot super lightweight. 

It is written in JavaScript using the discord.js v14 library, and uses the MongoDB database program.

## How was Polaris made?

RoboTop, Colon's previous bot, was his original multi-purpose bot, with many fun and moderation features. 

Unfortunately, since he made that bot when he just started programming, the codebase is an absolute mess. 

He is going to shut it down, replacing RoboTop with Polaris and Zoo (a RoboTop bot feature). You can read more about the shutdown [here.](https://www.notion.so/gdcolon/RoboTop-Shutdown-Info-FAQ-48395fd7815e498ab2b6595480dbd0bd)

He's also going to make RoboTop open sourced, with some exceptions with easter eggs and Zoo features.

### Issues

Polaris development was smooth. The only problem was Discord itself. 

More than 2 weeks ago, Polaris couldn't get verified because of its 'suspicious growth'. It couldn't be invited to more than 250 servers. 

Some useless Discord Support representatives saying that it couldn't be verified due to it storing data for longer than 30 days. Which was strange, because isn't this what every XP bot does?

After a gruesome 2 weeks, a useful Discord representative called KadyBat fixed the issue, and allowed Polaris to be verified. Finally! (Based Kady)

## Features

So, what exactly does Polaris offer that's different from other Discord Bots? Well once again, it has no paywalls. If you use MEE6, you know most features are paywalled, even though they're relatively easy to program by yourself.

Even with MEE6 Premium, some features are still quite limited! So what's the point of buying Premium when you can use another bot?

### Basic Settings

That is where Polaris comes in. You get your settings that XP bots need, such as how much XP is given per message, and what the cooldown is. With the maximum being 5000 XP, and the cooldown maximum being 31536000 seconds ***(1 year!)***

### Level Scaling

The more important feature (THAT ISN'T PAYWALLED) is Level Scaling!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pVdfacl.jpg" alt="Level Scaling UI" style="border-radius: 0.75rem"/>

Now it looks complicated (or not if you're good at math) but it's just a cubic function that determines how much XP is needed per level. So for level 1, you need 200 XP, level 2, 400 XP, etc. You can change it yourself if you know how to.

If that still looks tedious, a friendly reminder that user experience is kept in mind, and you can use a simple preset! There are multiple varying from Minecraft XP curves, RoboTop XP curves, and even.. MEE6 XP curves?? Yup.

### Reward Roles

Another feature (THAT'S NOT PAYWALLED) regularly seen in XP Bots. With a much more intuitive UI to customize them in!

You are also able to sync roles. It basically means if you're already a certain level (let's say level 10) and the server owner adds a new role that can be unlocked at level 10. Of course since you're already level 10, you won't get the role. However, with role syncing, you can type a simple `/sync` command, and it will give you the missing role! 

You can even make it automated. On XP Gain (the ideal option) or on Level Up. Heck, if you're evil, you can turn it off üòà

Bonus feature: If you have premade level roles [eg. Level 40 (God Activity)] and add them to level roles, the website will automatically determine which level it should give it at based on the number in the role. Quite a neat feature!

### Level Up Messages

Another common feature (THAT ISN'T PAYWALLE-) you're able to send custom level up messages to your members! Except now, It's more customizable than ever before.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/luzLh6Y.jpg" style="border-radius: 0.75rem">

You can do it the classic way, by simply sending a regular message whenever someone levels up. You can splice it up with some variables, like what level someone is, how much xp is required for the next level, etc.

Or you can do it the fancier way - you can actually customize the level up message as an embed!

Simply follow the instructions on how to turn the embed into a Crisp and Beautiful JSON‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, and you'll have a banger looking level up message!

Another small thing - do you not want people to clutter the chat with level up messages? Well you can have multiples! For example, you can send one level up message per 5 levels. 

Or, you can have it send a level up message only if you get a reward role. 

You can also disable the multiples when someone reaches a certain level, so now it goes back to sending a level up message every level.

### Multipliers

Another common feature (it's an XP bot what do you want?) is multipliers, which is just boosting someone's XP gain (or reducing if you're feeling especially dirty) depending on which channel they're in, or what role they have.

Let's say you have a role for server boosters, you can make them gain 2x the amount of XP they normally gain.

With some extra features like role priority and stacking, it makes it less of a hassle to deal with multipliers. (also don't forget it's not payw-)

### Leaderboards

You all know what a leaderboard does. Polaris allows you to make it private, hide reward roles, add a minimum level to appear on the leaderboard, and add a maximum amount of members to appear on the leaderboard. It's simple.

However, I vibe more with the actual leaderboard website. It looks clean, using the colors as your role color, and even has a dedicated page to showing your rank's stats, and list of every level and how close you're getting there.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VNnfCuV.jpg" alt="leaderboard rank page" style="border-radius: 0.75rem;"/>

(There are more pages, such as the ones I mentioned, but I dont want to flood this place with images)

### Data

This is like the Danger Zone. Here, you can download everyone's XP into a single file to back it all up, reset all the XP in a server, reset all settings, the usual.

But you can also import XP from another bot. You guys are probably wondering "Big deal, it's RoboTop right? After all, that's what this bot is made to replace." Well... yes. However...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dSBfnqT.jpg" alt="RIP MEE6 LOL" style="border-radius: 0.75rem;" width="500"/>

A huge kick in the guts for MEE6! Since the API is public, Colon was able to get importing MEE6 XP working in Polaris. So if your current server is using MEE6 and you want to switch to Polaris, well here's your good news.

> Sometimes MEE6 transfer won't work. I don't know if it's an API issue, but check back if you want to transfer from MEE6!
{: .prompt-warning }

You can even import the settings, level up messages, it's crazy. Props to Colon for this, reducing the amount of MEE6 users is for a good cause üòÄ

## How to Invite

Do you want to use Polaris as your primary XP bot now? Well it has been officially released right as I'm writing this, so you can go check it out at [gdcolon.com/polaris](https://gdcolon.com/polaris/) and get it for your server today!

If you have any questions, you can join the official RoboTop (well, it's still called that since it hasn't shut down yet) server [here!](https://discord.gg/EFSyBHdRNw)

That's it for now, stay tuned for the next blog, most likely going to review the September 7 Apple Event. Goodbye!
