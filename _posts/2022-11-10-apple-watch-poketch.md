## What is the Pok√©tch App?

The Pok√©tch App is an app recreating the Pok√©tch in Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl. It has most features that the original Pok√©tch includes, such as a Dowsing Machine. (Of course, it wouldn't work lol)

You can find the app here: [https://github.com/IdreesInc/Apple-Watch-Poketch](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Apple-Watch-Poketch)<br>

### Requirements

**Any Mac Computer** - You need to use Xcode to sideload the app onto the Apple Watch. This is the only method available.

**Xcode** - Just a simple app on the App Store, though it is 7 gigabytes, so I would clean up some space!

### Downloading the files

To start, head to the Releases tab in GitHub page. Click on Build 1.1, or the latest version there is. Once you're in, download the **Source Code (zip)**. Do not download the Poketch.ipa, as that won't work in our situation. Once you downloaded it, open it to extract it.

Next, open the file ***Poketch.xcodeproj*** inside the folder. It should open a new window in Xcode.

### Setting up

I may go a bit out of order here, but it doesn't matter, it will still work.

First, head to the menu bar and click *Xcode > Settings*, then head to the Accounts tab. There, press the **+** button to add your Apple ID. This will be needed for the sideloading process.

Next, on the sidebar, click on Poketch, then in each of the targets, click on one of them, and click Signing & Capabilities, then Teams, then your Apple ID you entered. You must do this for every target, or else the code will not build.

Watch recommendations: 

Budget Watch: SE 2
Regular Watch: Series 7 (Series 8 if you're a woman)
Ultimate Watch: Ultra (of course)

### AirPods Pro

The best yet. I usually don't recommend the regular AirPods as they don't have the noise cancelling + transparency mode. I'm all for the Pros, and I've been waiting for these features on the Pros for a while now.

My recommendation: Get it if you're a new AirPods user/have regular AirPods, hold off until your current pair dies if you have the 1st gen AirPods Pro

### iPhone 14

Nah. If you have anything newer than the 11, YOU DON'T NEED TO UPGRADE. The iPhone 14 is pretty much just a recycled iPhone 13.

I'd still spring for an iPhone 12, but you can get the later models if you want.

The iPhone 14 Pro on the other hand is really cool. Dynamic Island took the pill idea to where nobody saw it coming. I think it's cool. If you want a Pro iPhone this is a good one.

## Overall

The event was presented like a regular September Event. It was entertaining, had good editing (except for that one editing error) however no Craig and minimal comedy. It's still better than the March 2022 Event (ü§Æ), I'd give it a low B tier.

Best part was definitely the Apple Watches. It actually kinda got me back into my Apple Watch again. Looking forward to iOS 16 though!
