## Introduction

So, if you're here, you probably came from my video about playing Geometry Dash with a Wii Balance Board. Now if the introduction seemed confusing to you (chances are yes) then let's get started.

## How DO I do it?

I forgot to mention - If you're on Mac, this won't work, since it's a `.exe`. Linux users should know how to use Wine by now (Actually, Wine works on Mac too, but I don't have a Mac and never used it on there. You could try using Wine to get it working)

### Step 1: Download

Download the `.zip` containing the files [here](https://github.com/lshachar/WiiBalanceWalker/releases/download/v0.5/WiiBalanceWalker_x86.zip) and extract it. (If the `.exe` doesn't work, try [this](https://github.com/lshachar/WiiBalanceWalker/releases/download/v0.5/WiiBalanceWalker_x64.zip) instead)

Once extracted (move the `.zip` to the Downloads folder, right click and extract) open `WiiBalanceWalker.exe`.

### Step 2: Setup

Once loaded, click on the `Add/Remove bluetooth Device` button. You should see a PIN. Copy the PIN.

Turn on the Wii Balance Board, open up the battery cover and hold the SYNC button.

Open Settings, then go to `Bluetooth & Devices -> Add Device -> Bluetooth`. If you see an input device with Nintendo in the name, that's the Balance Board.

Click on it, and it will prompt you with a PIN. Paste the copied PIN and continue. You're now connected!

Go back to Wii Balance Walker and click on Connect to Wii Balance Board. You should see a bunch of numbers change.

I also recommend clicking on the `Tare Balance Board` button, as it resets all weight values back to zero, makes it perfectly calibrated whilst on the ground. The raw weight should all become (-)0.x.

### Step 3: Actions

All I would change here is the Left and Right actions should both be mapped to `Key Up` or `Key Space`. Forward, Backward, everything else should be set to `Do Nothing`. The numbers don't mean anything, but I would set the Ratio Triggers to 1 just in case.

Now you can untick `Disable All Actions`, and open up Geometry Dash!

### Step 4: Play!

If you were following the board cam on the video, you can use those hand/foot methods to jump. Do whatever you want, but the responsiveness will vary depending on the method. I would just not recommend putting your hand on the spiky parts of the board, since that causes your hand to go crazy. I would place my hand right between the center line and the spiky area. The flat surface on there will still be just as responsive. With your foot it doesn't matter.

## That's it!

You can now play Geometry Dash with the Wii Balance Board! Share your progress, questions, concerns all in the new comments section down below! And if you haven't watched the video and decided to read this anyways, go watch the video [right now]().

Goodbye!

> If you watched the video, you may have caught that I said that the numbers next to each action triggers it depending on the weight (number) chosen. That is actually the value for how much X and Y movement there is when "Mouse Move" is selected.
