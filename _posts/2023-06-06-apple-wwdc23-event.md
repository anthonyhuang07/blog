## Hello!

It's been a while since I've posted here. I'm just gonna use the same template as my previous Apple Event post. Anyways, MY THOUGHTS!

### 15-Inch MacBook Air

This is simply just a 15 inch version of the M2 Air, with no revisions whatsoever, other than the screen size. And it's $300 extra, in Canadian dollars. Nothing special. If you want a bigger MacBook Air, get this, I guess.

### M2 Mac Studio

I kinda forgot the Mac Studio was still on M1. It's just a SoC upgrade, nothing new.

### Apple Silicon Mac Pro

We've been waiting for this one for a while now, and now the transition to Apple Silicon is complete (beat it intel). I'm excited to see the performance of this beast of a machine, and the reviews for this.

### iOS 17

Let's look over every feature we got here:

- Phone related stuff: The first thing they revealed is a lockscreen-like customizable contact profile that shows up in calls and stuff. I think it's cool, I guess. Live voicemail is cool, but most voicemails I get are scam voicemails anyways.
- Messages related stuff: I like the new way you send varying forms of media in iMessage, but that UI looks off. The icons aren't Apple-like and it looks more like something you'd find in Facebook Messenger. Check In can definitely be useful for many people, especially for events to let your friends know you're there. I honestly don't use iMessage that often so some of these features don't really concern me. These stickers, swipe to reply features and search filters definitely make me feel they're adding more features that Discord already has, which is fun I guess.
- FaceTime: The reaction effects using your hand gestures is cool, though it could annoying for a lot of people, hopefully (most definitely) it will be toggleable. 
- StandBy: Now this is a feature I like. Something interesting to look at when your phone is charging! Really cool for wireless charging users (me).
- Interactive Widgets: About time. I can finally perform a task on a widget ðŸ¤¯
- NameDrop: Wait, this isn't a thing? Oh, I forgot about contact posters.
- Journal: I'm sure this is a useful app for some people, it's pretty cool, I don't really have a use for this. Who knows?
- Better Autocorrect: Awesome! Even Craig acknowledged the change from "fucking" to "ducking" with autocorrect. Let's go!! ðŸ˜‚
- Offline Maps: Useful for camping and hiking and stuff where you can easily lose signal. 

### iPadOS 17

### macOS Sonoma

### Audio and Home

This one was cool.

#### AirPods
- Adaptive Audio: Excited to use this, going to see how well this works in real life.

### watchOS 10

### Apple Vision Pro
