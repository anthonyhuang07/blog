## Hello!

I am currently writing this 2 days after the event (yes I'm late i know) but anyways... MY THOUGHTS!

### Apple Watch

Apple Watch Series 8 - Unless you're a car enthusiast or a woman, you're better off with a Series 7. If you don't even care about the bigger screen, heck, a Series 6 will do! If you have a Series 4 or later, you really don't need to upgrade yet. Series 3 users, I recommend the SE or the Series 7. Not much has changed here.

Apple Watch SE 2 - A faster SE. And cheaper?? Definitely the go-to watch for new Apple Watch users or people upgrading from the Series 3. 100% recommend.

Apple Watch Ultra - This is it. People saying it's so expensive MATE look at the Garmin Adventure watches. $2000 and I don't see you complaining. This is the ultimate watch for people who do extreme activities. It's ugly because they needed to make it rugged. If you need an adventure watch but can't afford the Garmin, this might be a really good competitor. I also can't wait for someone to accidentally set off the watch's siren in class.

Watch recommendations: 

Budget Watch: SE 2
Regular Watch: Series 7 (Series 8 if you're a woman)
Ultimate Watch: Ultra (of course)

### AirPods Pro

The best yet. I usually don't recommend the regular AirPods as they don't have the noise cancelling + transparency mode. I'm all for the Pros, and I've been waiting for these features on the Pros for a while now.

My recommendation: Get it if you're a new AirPods user/have regular AirPods, hold off until your current pair dies if you have the 1st gen AirPods Pro

### iPhone 14

Nah. If you have anything newer than the 11, YOU DON'T NEED TO UPGRADE. The iPhone 14 is pretty much just a recycled iPhone 13.

I'd still spring for an iPhone 12, but you can get the later models if you want.

The iPhone 14 Pro on the other hand is really cool. Dynamic Island took the pill idea to where nobody saw it coming. I think it's cool. If you want a Pro iPhone this is a good one.

## Overall

The event was presented like a regular September Event. It was entertaining, had good editing (except for that one editing error) however no Craig and minimal comedy. It's still better than the March 2022 Event (ðŸ¤®), I'd give it a low B tier.

Best part was definitely the Apple Watches. It actually kinda got me back into my Apple Watch again. Looking forward to iOS 16 though!
