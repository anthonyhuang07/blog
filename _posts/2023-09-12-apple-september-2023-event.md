It's rundown time!

### Apple Watch

Apple Watch Series 9 - I don't know. It's an update, and it SUCKS. They talked about one new "big" feature (that isn't even a new concept for Apple Watches) and then switched to talking about the environment, and I thought they'd talk about more features. THAT'S IT. DOUBLE TAP. Whatever. It's just a Series 8. Upgrade not recommended for Series 4 or later users.

Apple Watch Ultra 2 - Same thing. New features are the same as Series 9, and is an upgrade of the original Ultra. Cool.

### iPhone 15

Upgrade Year!!! Anyone who has an iPhone 12 or older will want to upgrade to this one, if you want. We got a super cool matte finish on the back rather than just glass, Dynamic Island on the base model, really awesome camera that allows for a telephoto mode without an actual telephoto lens, perfect for me. And finally, the long awaited USB-C. Lightning is dead! The 2000 nit brightness outdoors is also an excellent touch. Fantastic upgrade, I recommend. WHY DOES IT STILL HAVE TO HAVE A 60HZ SCREEN THOUGH....

Cool Pro as well. Cool titanium finish, similar camera to last year, the new cool action button, the new chip is absolutely crazy, being able to now run ray-tracing. Oh right, this also has a USB 3.0 port instead of 2.0. Decent upgrade, but not for me.

## Overall

It was fine. Getting ready to pre-order the 15 100%.
